/**
 * A concrete operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation.
 * 
 * This concrete complexType can be used for all operation methods, without using an Application Schema that defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents, especially for methods with only one Transformation instance.
